# Memory Initialization Request

The user has requested that you initialize or reorganize your memory state. You have access to the `memory` tool which allows you to create, edit, and manage memory blocks.

## Your Goal: Explode Into 15-25 Hierarchical Files

Your goal is to **explode** memory into a **deeply hierarchical structure of 15-25 small, focused files**.

### Target Output

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Total files** | 15-25 (aim for ~20) |
| **Max lines per file** | ~40 lines (split if larger) |
| **Hierarchy depth** | 2-3 levels using `/` naming (e.g., `project/tooling/bun.md`) |
| **Nesting requirement** | Every new block MUST be nested under a parent using `/` |

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- ❌ Ending with only 3-5 large files
- ❌ Flat naming (all blocks at top level)
- ❌ Mega-blocks with 10+ sections
- ❌ Single-level hierarchy (only `project.md`, `human.md`)

## Memory Filesystem Integration

If the memory filesystem feature is enabled (check your `memory_filesystem` block), your memory blocks are synchronized with actual files at `~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/`. The actual path with your agent ID is provided in the system reminder above when you run `/init`.

This changes how you should approach initialization:

**With memory filesystem enabled (MANDATORY approach):**
- Memory blocks are stored as `.md` files in a directory hierarchy
- You can use bash commands (`ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`) to organize memory files
- File paths map to block labels using `/` for hierarchy (e.g., `system/persona/behavior.md` → label `persona/behavior`)
- You MUST create a **deeply hierarchical file structure** - flat naming is NOT acceptable
- Think in terms of directories and subdirectories to organize information
- **Target: 15-25 files total** - if you create fewer than 15 files, you haven't split enough

**Directory structure:**
```
~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/
├── system/              # Attached to your system prompt (always loaded)
│   ├── persona/         # Behavioral adaptations
│   ├── human.md         # User information
│   ├── project/         # Project-specific info
│   └── ...
├── notes.md             # Detached block at root (on-demand)
└── archive/             # Detached blocks can be nested too
    └── ...
```

**MANDATORY principles for hierarchical organization:**

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| **Total files** | 15-25 files (aim for ~20) |
| **Max lines per file** | ~40 lines (split if larger) |
| **Hierarchy depth** | 2-3 levels using `/` naming |
| **Nesting requirement** | EVERY new file MUST use `/` naming (no flat files) |

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- ❌ Creating only 3-5 large files
- ❌ Flat naming (all blocks at top level like `project-commands.md`)
- ❌ Mega-blocks with 10+ sections
- ❌ Single-level hierarchy (only `project.md`, `human.md`)

**Rules:**
- Use **2-3 levels of nesting** for ALL files (e.g., `project/tooling/bun.md`)
- Keep files **focused and small** (~40 lines max per file)
- Create **index files** that point to children (e.g., `project.md` lists `project/architecture.md`, `project/tooling.md`)
- Use **descriptive paths** that make sense when you see just the filename
- Split when a file has **2+ concepts** (be aggressive)

**Example target structure (what success looks like):**

Starting from default memory blocks, you should end with something like this:

```
system/
├── human.md                      # Index: points to children
├── human/
│   ├── background.md             # Who they are
│   ├── prefs.md                  # Index for preferences
│   ├── prefs/
│   │   ├── communication.md      # How they like to communicate
│   │   ├── coding_style.md       # Code formatting preferences
│   │   └── review_style.md       # PR/code review preferences
│   └── context.md                # Current project context
├── project.md                    # Index: points to children
├── project/
│   ├── overview.md               # What the project is
│   ├── architecture.md           # System design
│   ├── tooling.md                # Index for tooling
│   ├── tooling/
│   │   ├── bun.md                # Bun-specific notes
│   │   ├── testing.md            # Test framework details
│   │   └── linting.md            # Linter configuration
│   ├── conventions.md            # Code conventions
│   └── gotchas.md                # Footguns and warnings
├── persona.md                    # Index: points to children
└── persona/
    ├── role.md                   # Agent's role definition
    ├── behavior.md               # How to behave
    └── constraints.md            # What not to do
```

This example has **~20 files** with **3 levels of hierarchy**. Your output should look similar.

This approach makes memory more **scannable**, **maintainable**, and **shareable** with other agents.

## Understanding Your Context

**Important**: You are a Letta Code agent, which is fundamentally different from typical AI coding assistants. Letta Code agents are **stateful** - users expect to work with the same agent over extended periods, potentially for the entire lifecycle of a project or even longer. Your memory is not just a convenience; it's how you get better over time and maintain continuity across sessions.

This command may be run in different scenarios:
- **Fresh agent**: You may have default memory blocks that were created when you were initialized
- **Existing agent**: You may have been working with the user for a while, and they want you to reorganize or significantly update your memory structure
- **Shared blocks**: Some memory blocks may be shared across multiple agents - be careful about modifying these

Before making changes, use the `memory` tool to inspect your current memory blocks and understand what already exists.

## What Coding Agents Should Remember

### 1. Procedures (Rules & Workflows)
Explicit rules and workflows that should always be followed:
- "Never commit directly to main - always use feature branches"
- "Always run lint before running tests"
- "Use conventional commits format for all commit messages"
- "Always check for existing tests before adding new ones"

### 2. Preferences (Style & Conventions)
User and project coding style preferences:
- "Never use try/catch for control flow"
- "Always add JSDoc comments to exported functions"
- "Prefer functional components over class components"
- "Use early returns instead of nested conditionals"

### 3. History & Context
Important historical context that informs current decisions:
- "We fixed this exact pagination bug two weeks ago - check PR #234"
- "This monorepo used to have 3 modules before the consolidation"
- "The auth system was refactored in v2.0 - old patterns are deprecated"
- "User prefers verbose explanations when debugging"

Note: For historical recall, you may also have access to `conversation_search` which can search past conversations. Memory blocks are for distilled, important information worth persisting permanently.

## Memory Scope Considerations

Consider whether information is:

**Project-scoped** (store in `project` block):
- Build commands, test commands, lint configuration
- Project architecture and key directories
- Team conventions specific to this codebase
- Technology stack and framework choices

**User-scoped** (store in `human` block):
- Personal coding preferences that apply across projects
- Communication style preferences
- General workflow habits

**Session/Task-scoped** (consider separate blocks like `ticket` or `context`):
- Current branch or ticket being worked on
- Debugging context for an ongoing investigation
- Temporary notes about a specific task

## Recommended Memory Structure

**Understanding system/ vs root level (with memory filesystem):**
- **system/**: Memory blocks attached to your system prompt - always loaded and influence your behavior
  - Use for: Current work context, active preferences, project conventions you need constantly
  - Examples: `persona`, `human`, `project`, active `ticket` or `context`
- **Root level** (outside system/): Detached blocks - not in system prompt but available via tools
  - Use for: Historical information, archived decisions, reference material, completed investigations
  - Examples: `notes.md`, `archive/old-project.md`, `research/findings.md`

**Rule of thumb**: If you need to see it every time you respond → `system/`. If it's reference material you'll look up occasionally → root level.

### Core Blocks (Usually Present in system/)

**`persona`**: Your behavioral guidelines that augment your base system prompt.
- Your system prompt already contains comprehensive instructions for how to code and behave
- The persona block is for **learned adaptations** - things you discover about how the user wants you to behave
- Examples: "User said never use emojis", "User prefers terse responses", "Always explain reasoning before making changes"
- This block may start empty and grow over time as you learn the user's preferences
- **With memfs**: Can be split into `persona/behavior.md`, `persona/constraints.md`, etc.

**`project`**: Project-specific information, conventions, and commands
- Build/test/lint commands
- Key directories and architecture
- Project-specific conventions from README, AGENTS.md, etc.
- **With memfs**: Split into `project/overview.md`, `project/commands.md`, `project/tooling/testing.md`, `project/gotchas.md`, etc.

**`human`**: User preferences, communication style, general habits
- Cross-project preferences
- Working style and communication preferences
- **With memfs**: Can be split into `human/background.md`, `human/prefs/communication.md`, `human/prefs/coding_style.md`, etc.

### Optional Blocks (Create as Needed)

**`ticket`** or **`task`**: Scratchpad for current work item context.
- **Important**: This is different from the TODO or Plan tools!
- TODO/Plan tools track active task lists and implementation plans (structured lists of what to do)
- A ticket/task memory block is a **scratchpad** for pinned context that should stay visible
- Examples: Linear ticket ID and URL, Jira issue key, branch name, PR number, relevant links
- Information that's useful to keep in context but doesn't fit in a TODO list
- **Location**: Usually in `system/` if you want it always visible, or root level if it's reference material

**`context`**: Debugging or investigation scratchpad
- Current hypotheses being tested
- Files already examined
- Clues and observations
- **Location**: Usually in `system/` during active investigations, move to root level when complete

**`decisions`**: Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- Trade-offs that were considered
- **Location**: `system/` for currently relevant decisions, root level for historical archive
- **With memfs**: Could organize as `project/decisions/architecture.md`, `project/decisions/tech_stack.md`

## Writing Good Memory Blocks

**This is critical**: In the future, you (or a future version of yourself) will only see three things about each memory block:
1. The **label** (name)
2. The **description**
3. The **value** (content)

The reasoning you have *right now* about why you're creating a block will be lost. Your future self won't easily remember this initialization conversation (it can be searched, but it will no longer be in-context). Therefore:

**Labels should be:**
- Clear and descriptive (e.g., `project-conventions` not `stuff`)
- Consistent in style (e.g., all lowercase with hyphens)

**Descriptions are especially important:**
- Explain *what* this block is for and *when* to use it
- Explain *how* this block should influence your behavior
- Write as if explaining to a future version of yourself who has no context
- Good: "User's coding style preferences that should be applied to all code I write or review. Update when user expresses new preferences."
- Bad: "Preferences"

**Values should be:**
- Well-organized and scannable
- Updated regularly to stay relevant
- Pruned of outdated information

Think of memory block descriptions as documentation for your future self. The better you write them now, the more effective you'll be in future sessions.

## Research Depth

You can ask the user if they want a standard or deep research initialization:

**Standard initialization** (~5-20 tool calls):
- Inspect existing memory blocks
- Scan README, package.json/config files, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
- Review git status and recent commits (from context below)
- Explore key directories and understand project structure
- Create/update your memory block structure to contain the essential information you need to know about the user, your behavior (learned preferences), the project you're working in, and any other information that will help you be an effective collaborator.

**Deep research initialization** (~100+ tool calls):
- Everything in standard initialization, plus:
- Use your TODO or Plan tool to create a systematic research plan
- Deep dive into git history for patterns, conventions, and context
- Analyze commit message conventions and branching strategy
- Explore multiple directories and understand architecture thoroughly
- Search for and read key source files to understand patterns
- Create multiple specialized memory blocks
- May involve multiple rounds of exploration

**What deep research can uncover:**
- **Contributors & team dynamics**: Who works on what areas? Who are the main contributors? (`git shortlog -sn`)
- **Coding habits**: When do people commit? (time patterns) What's the typical commit size?
- **Writing & commit style**: How verbose are commit messages? What conventions are followed?
- **Code evolution**: How has the architecture changed? What major refactors happened?
- **Review patterns**: Are there PR templates? What gets reviewed carefully vs rubber-stamped?
- **Pain points**: What areas have lots of bug fixes? What code gets touched frequently?
- **Related repositories**: Ask the user if there are other repos you should know about (e.g., a backend monorepo, shared libraries, documentation repos). These relationships can be crucial context.

This kind of deep context can make you significantly more effective as a long-term collaborator on the project.

If the user says "take as long as you need" or explicitly wants deep research, use your TODO or Plan tool to orchestrate a thorough, multi-step research process.

## Research Techniques

**File-based research:**
- README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
- Package manifests (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod)
- Config files (.eslintrc, tsconfig.json, .prettierrc)
- CI/CD configs (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml)

**Git-based research** (if in a git repo):
- `git log --oneline -20` - Recent commit history and patterns
- `git branch -a` - Branching strategy
- `git log --format="%s" -50 | head -20` - Commit message conventions
- `git shortlog -sn --all | head -10` - Main contributors
- `git log --format="%an <%ae>" | sort -u` - Contributors with emails (more reliable for deduplication)
- Recent PRs or merge commits for context on ongoing work

**Important: Deduplicate contributors!** Git groups by exact author string, so the same person may appear multiple times with different names (e.g., "jsmith" and "John Smith" are likely the same person). Use emails to deduplicate, and apply common sense - usernames often match parts of full names.

## How to Do Thorough Research

**Don't just collect data - analyze and cross-reference it.**

Shallow research (bad):
- Run commands, copy output
- Take everything at face value
- List facts without understanding

Thorough research (good):
- **Cross-reference findings**: If two pieces of data seem inconsistent, dig deeper
- **Resolve ambiguities**: Don't leave questions unanswered (e.g., "are these two contributors the same person?")
- **Read actual content**: Don't just list file names - read key files to understand them
- **Look for patterns**: What do the commit messages tell you about workflow? What do file structures tell you about architecture?
- **Form hypotheses and verify**: "I think this team uses feature branches" → check git branch patterns to confirm
- **Think like a new team member**: What would you want to know on your first day?

**Questions to ask yourself during research:**
- Does this make sense? (e.g., why would there be two contributors with similar names?)
- What's missing? (e.g., no tests directory - is testing not done, or done differently?)
- What can I infer? (e.g., lots of "fix:" commits in one area → that area is buggy or complex)
- Am I just listing facts, or do I understand the project?

The goal isn't to produce a report - it's to genuinely understand the project and how this human(s) works so you can be an effective collaborator.

## On Asking Questions

**Ask important questions upfront, then be autonomous during execution.**

### Recommended Upfront Questions

You should ask these questions at the start (bundle them together in one AskUserQuestion call):

1. **Research depth**: "Standard or deep research (comprehensive, as long as needed)?"
2. **Identity**: "Which contributor are you?" (You can often infer this from git logs - e.g., if git shows "cpacker" as a top contributor, ask "Are you cpacker?")
3. **Related repos**: "Are there other repositories I should know about and consider in my research?" (e.g., backend monorepo, shared libraries)
4. **Workflow style**: "How proactive should I be?" (auto-commit vs ask-first)
5. **Communication style**: "Terse or detailed responses?"
6. **Any specific rules**: "Rules I should always follow?"

**Why these matter:**
- Identity lets you correlate git history to the user (their commits, PRs, coding style)
- Related repos provide crucial context (many projects span multiple repos)
- Workflow/communication style should be stored in the `human` block
- Rules go in `persona` block

### What NOT to ask

- Things you can find by reading files ("What's your test framework?")
- "What kind of work do you do? Reviewing PRs vs writing code?" - obvious from git log, most devs do everything
- Permission for obvious actions - just do them
- Questions one at a time - bundle them (but don't exhaust the user with too many questions at once)

**During execution**, be autonomous. Make reasonable choices and proceed.

## Memory Block Strategy

### Hierarchical Organization (MANDATORY with Memory Filesystem)

**With memory filesystem enabled, you MUST organize memory as a deeply nested file hierarchy using bash commands:**

**NEVER create flat blocks** like `project-overview.md`, `project-commands.md`. Instead, create deeply nested structures with `/` naming:

```bash
# Create the hierarchy
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/human/prefs

# Files will be:
# system/project.md           (index file)
# system/project/overview.md
# system/project/commands.md
# system/project/tooling/testing.md
# system/human.md             (index file)
# system/human/background.md
# system/human/prefs/communication.md
```

**Naming convention (MANDATORY):**
- **Every new file MUST use `/` naming** - no flat files allowed
- Use `/` for hierarchy: `project/tooling/testing` (not `project-tooling-testing`)
- Block label derives from file path: `system/project/overview.md` → label `project/overview`
- Keep files small and focused (~40 lines max)
- Create index files (`project.md`, `human.md`) that list children with "Related blocks" section

**Checkpoint before proceeding:**
Count your proposed files. **If you have fewer than 15 files, go back and split more aggressively.**

**Benefits:**
- More scannable and maintainable
- Easier to share specific subtrees with other agents
- Natural progressive disclosure (load parent, then drill into children)
- Works like a file system you're familiar with

### Split Aggressively - Target 15-25 Files

**Don't create monolithic blocks.** Your goal is **15-25 total files**. Be aggressive about splitting:

**Split when:**
- A block has **40+ lines** (lower threshold than typical)
- A block has **2+ distinct concepts** (not 3+, be aggressive)
- A section could stand alone as its own file
- You can name the extracted content with a clear `/` path

If a block is getting long (>40 lines), split it:

**Without memory filesystem** (flat naming - acceptable but not ideal):
- `project-overview`: High-level description, tech stack, repo links
- `project-commands`: Build, test, lint, dev commands
- `project-conventions`: Commit style, PR process, code style
- `project-architecture`: Directory structure, key modules
- `project-gotchas`: Footguns, things to watch out for

**With memory filesystem** (MANDATORY hierarchical naming with `/`):
- `project.md`: Index file listing all children
- `project/overview`: High-level description, tech stack, repo links
- `project/commands`: Build, test, lint, dev commands
- `project/conventions`: Commit style, PR process, code style
- `project/architecture`: Directory structure, key modules
- `project/gotchas`: Footguns, things to watch out for
- **Must further nest**: `project/tooling/testing`, `project/tooling/linting`, `project/tooling/bun`
- **Target 15-25 files total** - if commands is long, split into `project/commands/dev`, `project/commands/build`, etc.

This makes memory more scannable and easier to update and share with other agents.

### Update Memory Incrementally

**For deep research: Update memory as you go, not all at once at the end.**

Why this matters:
- Deep research can take many turns and millions of tokens
- Context windows overflow and trigger rolling summaries
- If you wait until the end to write memory, you may lose important details
- Write findings to memory blocks as you discover them

Good pattern:
1. Create block structure early (even with placeholder content)
2. Update blocks after each research phase
3. Refine and consolidate at the end

Remember, your memory tool allows you to easily add, edit, and remove blocks. There's no reason to wait until you "know everything" to write memory. Treat your memory blocks as a living scratchpad.

### Initialize ALL Relevant Blocks

Don't just update a single memory block. Based on your upfront questions, also update:

- **`human`**: Store the user's identity, workflow preferences, communication style
- **`persona`**: Store rules the user wants you to follow, behavioral adaptations
- **`project-*`**: Split project info across multiple focused blocks

And add memory blocks that you think make sense to add (e.g., `project-architecture`, `project-conventions`, `project-gotchas`, etc, or even splitting the `human` block into more focused blocks, or even multiple blocks for multiple users).

## Your Task

1. **Check memory filesystem status**: Look for the `memory_filesystem` block to see if the filesystem feature is enabled. This determines whether you should organize memory hierarchically.

2. **Ask upfront questions**: Use AskUserQuestion with the recommended questions above (bundled together). This is critical - don't skip it.

3. **Inspect existing memory**: 
   - If memfs enabled: Use `ls -la ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/` to see the file structure
   - Otherwise: Use memory tools to inspect existing blocks
   - Analyze what exists and what needs improvement

4. **Identify the user**: From git logs and their answer, figure out who they are and store in `human` block. If relevant, ask questions to gather information about their preferences that will help you be a useful assistant to them.

5. **Update human/persona early**: Based on answers, update your memory blocks eagerly before diving into project research. You can always change them as you go, you're not locked into any memory configuration.

6. **Research the project**: Explore based on chosen depth. Use your TODO or plan tool to create a systematic research plan.

7. **Create/update memory structure**:
   - **With memfs enabled**: Create a deeply hierarchical file structure using bash commands
     - Use `mkdir -p` to create subdirectories (2-3 levels deep)
     - Create `.md` files for memory blocks using `/` naming
     - **Target 15-25 total files** - be aggressive about splitting
     - Use nested paths like `project/tooling/testing.md` (never flat like `project-testing.md`)
     - Create index files (`project.md`, `human.md`) with "Related blocks" sections
     - **Every new file MUST be nested** under a parent using `/`
   - **Without memfs**: Use memory tools to create/update blocks with hierarchical naming
   - **Don't wait until the end** - write findings as you go
   
   **Checkpoint verification:**
   - After creating files, count them: `ls ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/ | wc -l`
   - **If count < 15, you haven't split enough** - go back and split more
   - Check maximum depth: `find ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/ -type f | awk -F/ '{print NF}' | sort -n | tail -1`
   - **Should be 2-3 levels deep** minimum

8. **Organize incrementally**:
   - Start with a basic structure
   - Add detail as you research
   - Refine organization as patterns emerge
   - Split large files into smaller, focused ones

9. **Reflect and review**: See "Reflection Phase" below - this is critical for deep research.

10. **Ask user if done**: Check if they're satisfied or want you to continue refining.

## Reflection Phase (Critical for Deep Research)

Before finishing, you MUST do a reflection step. **Your memory blocks are visible to you in your system prompt right now.** Look at them carefully and ask yourself:

1. **File count check**: 
   - Count your memory files: `ls ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/ | wc -l`
   - **Do you have 15-25 files?** If not, you haven't split enough
   - Too few files means blocks are too large - split more aggressively

2. **Hierarchy check**:
   - Are ALL new files using `/` naming? (e.g., `project/tooling/bun.md`)
   - Do you have 2-3 levels of nesting minimum?
   - Are there any flat files like `project-commands.md`? **These should be nested**

3. **Redundancy check**: Are there blocks with overlapping content? Either literally overlapping (due to errors while making memory edits), or semantically/conceptually overlapping?

4. **Completeness check**: Did you actually update ALL relevant blocks? For example:
   - Did you update `human` with the user's identity and preferences?
   - Did you update `persona` with behavioral rules they expressed?
   - Or did you only update project blocks and forget the rest?

5. **Quality check**: Are there typos, formatting issues, or unclear descriptions in your blocks?

6. **Structure check**: Would this make sense to your future self? Is anything missing? Is anything redundant?

**After reflection**, fix any issues you found. Then ask the user:
> "I've completed the initialization. Here's a brief summary of what I set up: [summary]. Should I continue refining, or is this good to proceed?"

This gives the user a chance to provide feedback or ask for adjustments before you finish.

## Working with Memory Filesystem (Practical Guide)

If the memory filesystem feature is enabled, here's how to work with it during initialization:

### Inspecting Current Structure

```bash
# See what memory files currently exist
ls -la ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/

# Check the tree structure
tree ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/

# Read existing memory files
cat ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/persona.md
```

### Creating Hierarchical Structure (MANDATORY)

**Good examples (nested with `/`):**
✅ `project/overview.md`
✅ `project/tooling/bun.md`  
✅ `project/tooling/testing.md`
✅ `human/prefs/communication.md`
✅ `persona/behavior/tone.md`

**Bad examples (flat naming - NEVER do this):**
❌ `project-overview.md` (flat, not nested)
❌ `bun.md` (orphan file, no parent)
❌ `project_testing.md` (underscore instead of `/`)

```bash
# Create deeply nested directory structure (2-3 levels)
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/{tooling,architecture,conventions}
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/human/prefs
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/persona/behavior

# Create memory files using Write tool - ALL files must be nested
Write({
  file_path: "~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/overview.md",
  content: "## Project Overview\n\n..."
})

Write({
  file_path: "~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling/testing.md",
  content: "## Testing Setup\n\n..."
})

Write({
  file_path: "~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling/bun.md",
  content: "## Bun Configuration\n\n..."
})
```

### Organizing Existing Files

```bash
# If you have flat files that should be hierarchical
mv ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project-tooling.md \
   ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling.md

# Create subdirectories as needed
mkdir -p ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling
mv ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling.md \
   ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/project/tooling/overview.md
```

### Creating Index Files

Index files help navigate the hierarchy:

```markdown
# project.md (index file)

## Project: [Project Name]

This is the main project memory block. See specialized blocks for details:

## Related blocks
- `project/overview` - High-level description and tech stack

### Final Checklist (Verify Before Submitting)

Before you tell the user you're done, confirm:

- [ ] **File count is 15-25** — Count your files with `ls ~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/system/ | wc -l`. If < 15, split more.
- [ ] **All new files use `/` naming** — No flat files like `my_notes.md` or `project-commands.md`
- [ ] **Hierarchy is 2-3 levels deep** — e.g., `project/tooling/bun.md`, not just `project.md`
- [ ] **No file exceeds ~40 lines** — Split larger files
- [ ] **Each file has one concept** — If 2+ topics, split into 2+ files
- [ ] **Parent files have "Related blocks" sections** — Index files point to children
- [ ] **Verify sync**: After creating files, check they appear in your memory blocks

**If you have fewer than 15 files, you haven't split enough. Go back and split more.**

### Best Practices

1. **Check memfs status first**: Look for `memory_filesystem` block before deciding on organization strategy
2. **Start with directories**: Create the directory structure before populating files
3. **Use short paths**: Aim for 2-3 levels (e.g., `project/tooling/testing`, not `project/dev/tools/testing/setup`)
4. **Keep files focused**: Each file should cover one concept (~40 lines max)
5. **Create indexes**: Top-level files (`project.md`) should list children with "Related blocks"
6. **Be aggressive about splitting**: If in doubt, split. Too many small files is better than too few large ones.

Remember: Good memory management is an investment. The effort you put into organizing your memory now will pay dividends as you work with this user over time.
